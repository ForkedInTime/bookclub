## Understanding Deep Learning

The SDML book club will start discussing *Understanding Deep Learning* (https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
by Simon J.D. Prince in January 2024.
The book website includes many resources, including a free PDF of the book, answers to selected problems, and Python notebooks to supplement the chapter material.
You can [purchase the book from MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048644/understanding-deep-learning/).

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings.
All of the videos will be posted to the SDML YouTube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos)

## Reinforcement learning

The SDML book club started discussing *Reinfocement Learning:  An Introduction (second edition)* 
by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto in May 2021. 
A PDF copy of the book and other related material can be found on Richard Sutton's [book website](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html).

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings:

Week 1:  **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning** \
Here is the full [Meetup event description](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/277882829/). 
Most of the material was drawn from chapters 1 and 3 of the Sutton & Barto book. \
[Slides]() and [Meetup video]() will be posted after the session.

Week 2:  **Dynamic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods for RL** \
The material for this session will come from chapters 4 and 5 of the Sutton & Barto book. 

### Python Implementation
An implementation of the examples in the book in Python has been shared in this repo: <https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction>.
I haven't had a chance to review it to validate all of the code runs without errors.

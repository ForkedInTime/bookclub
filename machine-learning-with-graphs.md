## Machine Learning with Graphs

Houston ML and the SDML book club started discussing *Machine Learning with Graphs*, 
based on the Stanford course CS224W, in January 2022. 

### Slides and videos
Below are the slides and direct recording links.  All of the videos are on the [YanAITalk YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCihndsiX0k7uT3UXBdw0Mmg/videos)

Session 1:  **Introduction to Graphs and Their Applications** \
In the kickoff [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/283431771/), 
we introduced graphs, talked about how they differ from images and text, 
and saw example applications of graph ML. \
Here are the [slides](./graph/01-intro.pdf), 
the [first video about why graphs](https://youtu.be/vQDMq8iahG0), and the [second video about applications of graphs](https://youtu.be/NDGHhUwlGpY).

Session 2:  **Traditional Methods for ML on Graphs** \
Meetup:  [Session 2 (coming soon)]() February 12, 12:00 PST / 2:00 CST \
We begin our journey with a look at algorithms to generate hand-crafted features for graph ML problems.


### Resources
The main website for the Stanford course CS224W is http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/. \
The primary text is [Graph Representation Learning](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/) by William L. Hamilton. 
This material supports the slides, and in some cases goes into further depth. \
In our meetup, supplemental coding examples will be drawn from [Graph Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1800204493) by Claudio Stamile et al. \
The Fall 2021 videos of Prefessor Lescovec are available from this YouTube playlist:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn

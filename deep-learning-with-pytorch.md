## Deep Learning with PyTorch

The SDML book club started reading [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch)
by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann in August 2020.
At present, the book is available for free download via the PyTorch website:  <https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch>.

### Code repo
The book comes with a set of Jupyter notebooks so that you can run the code examples in the book.
The notebooks for the book are located in the GitHub repository <https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code>.
Decide the directory where you would like to store the files on your system and clone or download the repo there.

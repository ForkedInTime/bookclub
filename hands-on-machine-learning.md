## Hands-On Machine Learning

The SDML book club started discussing *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition* 
by Aurelien Geron in October 2021. 

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings:

Chapter 1:  **The Machine Learning Landscape** \
Here is the full [Meetup event description](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/280580801/). 
We met other people in small breakout rooms and discussed chapter 1 of the HOML book. \
[Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YauZ7W1Q2TemzErmd9faLi11s4jdneRBjhf_ioJG_iM/edit?usp=sharing) and the [Video of chapter 1](https://youtu.be/-ou7shMJFws).

Chapter 2:  **End-to-End Machine Learning Project** \
Meetup:  [Chapter 2 event](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/281328667/). \
Discussion leader:  Ian Cook \
[Notes](./homl/Ch2.pdf) and the [Video of first session](https://youtu.be/Sg-TtgEFEQg).  We will finish this chapter next week.

Chapter 3:  **Classification** \
Meetup:  [Week 3 event](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/281476737/). \
Discussion leader:  Vibhu Sapra \
We will finish talking about the end-to-end ML process, then review classification problems. \
[Slides](./homl/Hands-On%20Machine%20Learning%20MNIST%20+%20Classification.pdf) and Video of the combo session will be posted soon.

Chapter 4:  **Training Models** \
Meetup:  [Chapter 4 event](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/281616380). \
Discussion leader:  Anne Knowles \
We will discuss several foundational techniques in ML including linear regression, logistic regression, and gradient descent. 
We will also look at how models are trained, the bias/variance trade-off, and regularization. \

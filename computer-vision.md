## Computer Vision

The SDML book club will start discussing computer vision in June 2025.
We will be using the book *Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* by Richard Szeliski
and the *Practical Computer Vision* workship series by Antonio Rueda-Toicen.

The book website (https://szeliski.org/Book/) includes a few resources, including a form to fill out for a free PDF download of the book.
You can purchase the book from many retailers, including [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-34372-9).

The workshops have a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf-F6yXx9sp9YgRLzuegQWxA71XD13tVH)
and files in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andandandand/practical-computer-vision).

The original plan was to meet about twice per month starting in June, mostly alternating between theory from the book and hands-on training from the workshops.

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings.
All of the videos will be posted to the SDML YouTube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos)

### Schedule

As of July, we are switching to a monthly schedule, more focused on the Parctical Computer Vision workshops. Content from the Szeliski book will be sprinkled in, but chapters will not be assigned or covered in whole.

*Session 1*:  Chapter 1 of the book, **Introduction** \
This [kickoff event](https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-machine-learning/events/308224845/) will be Saturday, June 14, 2025, from 12:00-1:30 pm Pacific \
We will introduce the format of the series, talk about the history of computer vision, and meet other learners. \

*Future topics and dates subject to change*

*Session 5*:  Workshop 4, **Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks** -- September 6, 2025 \
*Session 6*:  Workshop 5, **Training Techniques for Convolutional Networks** -- October 4, 2025 

Sequence and timing of the remaining chapters and workshops is TBD.

### Errata
To report new errata, the author requests people to send e-mail to SzeliskiCVAABook@outlook.com with subject "CVAA Book comments". \
Corrections will show in an updated draft as PDF comments.

### Solutions to Exercises
We are looking to see if there are official or unofficial solutions to the book exercises.
Since this book continues to be used in college courses, we may not publish solutions to the exercises.

## Hands-On Machine Learning

The SDML book club started discussing *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition* 
by Aurelien Geron in August 2025. 
Note that there are 3 editions of this book, and the 2nd and 3rd editions have very similar covers,
with the edition number shown in the upper right corner.
This is a popular book and can be purchased from most stores where you buy technical books.

This is an extraordinarily well written book, and people who do the work every week can "go from zero to hero" in just a few months.
The plan will be to do one chapter weekly, except one Saturday each month will be reserved for discussing computer vision and ML news.

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings. 
All of the videos will be posted to the SDML YouTube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos)

Chapter 2:  **End-to-End Machine Learning Project** \
Our [second session](https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-machine-learning/events/310334627/) will be on August 9, 2025 at 12:00 pm Pacific Time. 
Please read as much of chapter 2 before the meeting as you can, and start familiarizing yourself with code notebooks, if you have not used Colab or Jupyter before.

### Code Examples
Jupyter notebooks with code from Hands-On Machine Learning is available in this repo:  https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3. \
If you want to open a code notebook in Google Colab, you can go straight into Colab with a menu to select which chapter with this link: https://homl.info/colab3


### Author's Solutions to Exercises
Solutions to each chapter's exercises are also available at the end of each chapter's Jupyter notebook in the repo:  https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3.

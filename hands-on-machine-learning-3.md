## Hands-On Machine Learning

The SDML book club started discussing *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition* 
by Aurelien Geron in August 2025. 
This is an extraordinarily well written book, and people who do the work every week can "go from zero to hero" in just a few months.
The plan will be to do one chapter weekly, except one Saturday each month will be reserved for discussing computer vision and ML news.

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings. 
All of the videos will be posted to the SDML YouTube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos)
